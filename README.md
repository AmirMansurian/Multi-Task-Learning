# Multi-Task Learning
### Transfer Learning, Multi-Task Learning, Meta Learning





Contributoins of this repo : 

- Train a nework with ProtoNet as backbone for classification task on CIFAR-10
- Using network in the last step and freeze it's backbone to classify tiny-images-subset (Trasnfer Learning)
- Multi-Task Learning (TODO)
- Meta-Learning (TODO)



## Transfer Learning

 - I have used ProtoNet backbone and have added to fully connected layers to it to train a network for classify images of CIFAR-10. 
 -  I have trained the same network on the tiny-images-subset
 -  using pre-trained network on the CIFAR-10 I have freezed it's backbone and just let FC layers to be updated
 -  using pre-trained network on the CIFAR-10 and let all of it's layers to be update
 -  I have compared results of 3 networks of last steps to show impact of Transfer Learning
